# React-Django-Python-GraphQL

Repo made for bundling different technologies such as React, Django (Python) and GraphQL.

## python-graphene
	
This is just a subfolder where I learn minimal concepts of GraphQL.

## react-tracks

Go inside the App folder and run 

```sh
$ pipenv shell
```

Then again, inside the app folder, run the backend django server

```sh
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Finally, inside the react-trackas-client folder, run the frontend server

```sh
$ npm run start
```
